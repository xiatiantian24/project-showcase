      <h3>The Big Problem</h3>
      <h4>
        BJC HealthCare wants to improve its open shift scheduling process
        because it lacks efficiency and personalization.
      </h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          With the current solution, nurses are only allowed to pick up shifts
          in set length (i.e., 12hrs) and at a single location.
        </p>

            <div class="tip-title">The user problem</div>
            <div class="tip-body">
              Nurse managers spend hours asking individual nurses to fill open
              shifts, while nurses are fatigued with notifications about shifts
              they're not able/interested in filling.
            </div>

          As a UX Designer, I joined to to understand the user pain points in
          shift scheduling, strategize desired solution features, push the
          launch of the MVP, and iterate on new and existing capabilities that
          are used by nurses and administrators daily across the org.

      <h4>
        The scheduling workflow involves two roles, each operating with only
        partial visibility into the overall process, creating a fragmented
        experience with little effective coordination.

              Nurse managers or central staffing coordinators who manage open
              shift coverage. They can notify nurses about staffing gaps but do
              not know nurse availability and willingness to fill.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before this initiative, open shift scheduling relies on manual
          processes with no centralized system to track the interactions between
          roles. When urgent staffing gaps appeared, nurse managers have to sit
          down and call every nurse one at a time, which is time consuming in
          addition to their other responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand deeper pain points behind this broken workflow and
          identify opportunities for improvement, I visited three BJC hospitals
          to observe and interview nurses and managers in their actual work
          environments.

      <h3>Solution Architecture and User Flow Design</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I met with senior designers to align on a dual-platform approach for
          our solution, BJC Flex.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I soon discovered a business constraint while discussing with
          our product manager: our solution had to integrate with Kronos, BJC's
          legacy workforce management system, as the official data source. This
          created potential delays in status updates, which could negatively
          impact the nurse scheduling experience and become critical for urgent
          shift scheduling.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a design meeting with the entire team, I contributed by pushing for
          a parallel processing architecture that provides immediate user
          feedback while syncing scheduling decisions with Kronos in the
          background. This approach ensures minimal impact on user experience
          while maintaining Kronos as the system of record.
        </p>
        <p>
          This architectural approach set up the foundation that influenced all
          our subsequent design decisions, including the user flow that connects
          the two platforms and two roles.

      <h3>MVP Development and Testing</h3>
      <h4>
        For our MVP launch, we focused on the core nurse experience: mobile
        shift browsing and one-step signup.
      </h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          As our research informed that giving nurses visibility into open
          shifts and proactive scheduling capabilities were key to streamlining
          the manual process, we prioritized creating a mobile experience that
          allows nurses to browse, filter, and sign up for shifts quickly.

          I conducted user testing sessions at the two pilot hospitals with
          nurses across different units. While we received positive feedback
          that validated our mobile-first approach, I discovered several
          challenges that are critical to the effectiveness of our solution.

      <h3>Challenges and Iterations</h3>
      <h4>Challenge 1: High error rates in shift selection</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          After MVP rollout, we discovered nurses were frequently signing up for
          shifts they couldn't actually work, which created extra manual cleanup
          work for administrators.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Through follow-up conversations with nurse managers, I was able to
          identify two primary causes:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-8">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Time confusion:</span> Nurses were overlooking
            whether shifts were day or night
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Schedule conflicts:</span> No system to warn
            about schedule conflicts
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Using layout, color, and iconography, I explored different variations
          of shift cards with stronger visual cues to distinguish day versus
          night shift. Combining rapid testing results and engineering team’s
          feedback from a design review, we selected the one that’s the most
          effective while remaining technically feasible to implement quickly.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <div class="figure-large mx-auto mb-12">

        <p>
          For scheduling conflict, our first attempt to simply disable all
          overlapping and back-to-back shifts proved too restrictive.
          Subsequently, I designed an additional confirmation modal to show
          warnings with conflict breakdown, allowing nurses to make informed
          decisions about consecutive shifts that may still work for their
          specific situations.

      <h4>Challenge 2: Limited flexibility with irregular shifts</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Unlike medical-surgical units with standard 12-hour shifts, schedules
          in emergency departments are highly irregular with unpredictable
          patient flow. Beyond our existing 4-hour increments, our solution
          needs to allow customizable start and end times in order to scale to
          different units.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">Two potential solutions I explored:</p>
        <p class="mb-2">

          Proactive information gathering in complex environments
        </h4>
        <p class="mb-8">
          Frequent stakeholder communications and early cross-functional
          communication proved essential to our success. I learned to actively
          engage with product managers to understand operational requirements,
          while building close relationships with engineers to learn technical
          constraints early, which allowed me to iterate toward a viable
          solution without major redesigns.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-2">Opportunity for greater business impact</h4>
        <p class="mb-8">
          If there’s more time, I would want to tackle additional business
          challenges through design. For example, we noticed that nurses
          naturally gravitated toward popular units and preferred hours,
          creating staffing imbalances. This problem could potentially be solved
          by dynamic staffing balance and incentive features.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-2">Design for breaking the status quo</h4>
        <p class="mb-8">
          This project reinforced my skills to balance understanding existing workflows with creative
          problem-solving approaches. As my manager noted: <span
            class="quote"
            >"The fresh pair of eyes helped us start with a clean slate and get
            us to where we are today. I had a few preconceived notions about
            user satisfaction that Ray effectively challenged. I've been
            impressed with Ray's design skills!"</span
