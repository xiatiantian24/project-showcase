      <h3>Research Findings</h3>
      <h4>
        The scheduling workflow involves two roles, each operating with only
        partial visibility into the overall process, creating a fragmented
        experience with little effective coordination.

              Nurse managers or central staffing coordinators who manage open
              shift coverage. They can notify nurses about staffing gaps but do
              not know nurse availability and willingness to fill.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before this initiative, open shift scheduling relies on manual
          processes with no centralized system to track the interactions between
          roles. When urgent staffing gaps appeared, nurse managers have to sit
          down and call every nurse one at a time, which is time consuming in
          addition to their other responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand deeper pain points behind this broken workflow and
          identify opportunities for improvement, I visited three BJC hospitals
          to observe and interview nurses and managers in their actual work
          environments.

      <h3>User Flow Design</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I met with senior designers to align on a dual-platform approach for
          our solution, BJC Flex.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I soon discovered a business constraint while discussing with
          our product manager: our solution had to integrate with Kronos, BJC's
          legacy workforce management system, as the official data source. This
          created potential delays in status updates, which could negatively
          impact the nurse scheduling experience and become critical for urgent
          shift scheduling.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a design meeting with the entire team, I contributed by pushing for
          a parallel processing architecture that provides immediate user
          feedback while syncing scheduling decisions with Kronos in the
          background. This approach ensures minimal impact on user experience
          while maintaining Kronos as the system of record.
        </p>
        <p>
          This architectural approach set up the foundation that influenced all
          our subsequent design decisions, including the user flow that connects
          the two platforms and two roles.

      <h3>MVP Development and Testing</h3>
      <h4>
        For our MVP launch, we focused on the core nurse experience: mobile
        shift browsing and one-step signup.
      </h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          As our research informed that giving nurses visibility into open
          shifts and proactive scheduling capabilities were key to streamlining
          the manual process, we prioritized creating a mobile experience that
          allows nurses to browse, filter, and sign up for shifts quickly.

          I conducted user testing sessions at the two pilot hospitals with
          nurses across different units. While we received positive feedback

          challenges that are critical to the effectiveness of our solution.

      <h3>Challenges and Iterations</h3>
      <h4>Challenge 1: High error rates in shift selection</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          After MVP rollout, we discovered nurses were frequently signing up for
          shifts they couldn't actually work, which created extra manual cleanup
          work for administrators.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Through follow-up conversations with nurse managers, I was able to
          identify two primary causes:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-8">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Time confusion:</span> Nurses were overlooking
            whether shifts were day or night
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Schedule conflicts:</span> No system to warn
            about schedule conflicts
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Using layout, color, and iconography, I explored different variations
          of shift cards with stronger visual cues to distinguish day versus
          night shift. Combining rapid testing results and engineering team’s
          feedback from a design review, we selected the one that’s the most
          effective while remaining technically feasible to implement quickly.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          For scheduling conflict, our first attempt to simply disable all
          overlapping and back-to-back shifts proved too restrictive.
          Subsequently, I designed an additional confirmation modal to show
          warnings with conflict breakdown, allowing nurses to make informed
          decisions about consecutive shifts that may still work for their
          specific situations.

      <h4>Challenge 2: Limited flexibility with irregular shifts</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Unlike medical-surgical units with standard 12-hour shifts, schedules
          in emergency departments are highly irregular with unpredictable
          patient flow. Beyond our existing 4-hour increments, our solution
          needs to allow customizable start and end times in order to scale to
          different units.

      <h4>Feedback 1: Recipient selection confusion</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          The initial side-by-side recipient interface created confusion for
          most managers. They didn't understand the relationship between the two
          panels and were overwhelmed by multiple actionable items with minimal
          guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recalling how email platforms like Gmail handle complex recipient
          management, I noticed they use focused, sequential steps for each
          action while separating advanced features (like group creation and
          editing) into different tabs, keeping them hidden from the primary
          messaging flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by this approach, I broke down the recipient selection
          process into a two step process, where preset groups selections are
          independent from additional individuals.

      <h4>Feedback 2: Cumbersome modal for shift attachment</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          I observed that managers were doing excessive scrolling during shift
          attachment, and the modal's position often blocked the context about
          the message.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, I redesigned a side panel that maintained context
          visibility while providing better shift browsing experience. With A/B
          testing, we quickly confirmed the value of this approach, as nurse
          managers appreciated the increased real estate for shift browsing and
          the ability to reference their message while selecting shifts.

      <h3>Reflections and Learnings</h3>
      <div>
        <h4 class="mb-2">
          Information gathering in complex environments
        </h4>
        <p class="mb-12">
          Enterprise teamwork needs proactive communication to move fast. I learned to
          frequently update with product managers to understand new operational
          requirements, while building relationships with engineers to learn
          technical constraints early.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-2">Solutions can create new problems</h4>
        <p class="mb-12">
          While the solution covers urgent staffing needs, it could sometimes
          cause staffing imbalances. If there's more time, I would've futher
          explored dynamic staffing and incentive features within the current
          solution.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-2">Design for breaking the status quo</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Through this experience, I was able to balance existing workflows with
          pitching creative approaches when there's opportunity. As my manager
          noted:
        </p>
        <div class="quote p-6">
          "The fresh pair of eyes helped us start with a clean slate and get us
          to where we are today. I had a few preconceived notions about user
          satisfaction that Ray effectively challenged. I've been impressed with
          Ray's design skills!"
