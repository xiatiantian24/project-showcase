          <p>
            In my last year of undergrad, I worked at a
            <a href="https://bjc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >hospital</a
            >
            - the dream job of fifth grade me. But instead of delivering care to
            the patients, I designed things that help people who are delivering care.

      <h3>Streamlining Shift Scheduling</h3>
      <div class="mb-24">
        <p>
          Due to nursing shortage, the amount of available shifts to be picked
          up is high. But at BJC, open shift scheduling requires multiple
          actions, platforms, and back-and-forth communication between nurses
          and nurse managers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of BJC Flex is to streamline shift scheduling, giving nurses
          agency to pickup the shifts they want and incentivizing them to stay.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>BJC Flex</h4>
      <h3>A New Messaging Tool</h3>
      <div class="mb-8">
        <p>
          To allow nurse managers to notify nurses about open shifts, I designed
          and pushed forward the launching of a messaging tool as part of BJC
          Flex.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was involved in every step of the design cycle, from concepting
          ideas and prototyping through user testing and gathering feedback
          on-site.

          Besides working on the exciting new features, I also had fun improving
          existing features based on nurses’ requests throughout my time at BJC.
          Some made it to the beta version, some didn’t but helped us better
          learn the prioritization of desirability.

          overlooking the time of the day.
