        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <h2>
          Summer 2023 at Datadog was no doubt one of the most incredible summers
          for me as a designer. Below are my top learnings:

            <h3>How to write design doc</h3>
            <p>
              At Datadog, if a designer wants to get feedback from the entire
              design org, they’ll write a design review doc. I found this to be
              super helpful and have continued to write design docs for all my
              projects.

            <h3>It’s not just about designing pixels</h3>
            <p>
              A lot of times, you may pump out the design in 1-2 days. But then
              you realize that there’s a lot of steps before it can be shipped.
              This includes: Talk to other product teams to see how my designs
              will affect them / Get approval from mentor, manager, PM, and
              engineering lead / Do design QA with engineer / Set up success
              metrics.

            <h3>Unblock yourself</h3>
            <p>
              It’s natural to wait for others. But it’s not okay to just…wait
              and do nothing. You can always take other initiatives such as
              getting started on another project, following up with the
              stakeholder or document your designs for future use.

            <h3>Different types of research</h3>
            <p>
              Before, my mental model of research always defaulted to user
              research. But, as my manager Roz said, there are so many types of
              research (competitive analysis, secondary research, asking PMs).
              And know when to use what’s already available in the company.

            <h3>Best practices to get quality feedback</h3>
            <p>
              Always provide context / where we left off. Specify what type of
              feedback I want. Know your audience and tailor your delivery. Make
              it stupidly easy to give feedback.

            <h3>Shout-out list for myself</h3>
            <p>
              My manager recommended me to do this during our 30 days check in.
              And it made me realize: Hey, it’s nice to pause sometime, reflect
              on the things I did do well, and pat myself on the back.
